Hi All!

Date 14.01.2020
I'm new to the coding in Terraform but recently I've started doing some tasks in it. 
So, in the project "Tags Merging" I need to add extra tags to all resources in respective modules. 
I was searching for the solutions for chaning default tags and adding more and I've found "merge" function in Terraform documentaion.
But for me the information in the documention no explained it fully so I've read more and do some testing. 
I hope that this sample can help you understand "how to do it".
